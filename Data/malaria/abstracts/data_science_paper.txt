BACKGROUND: Current knowledge on the burden of, and interactions between malaria 
and helminth co-infections, as well as the impact of the dual infections on
anaemia, remains inconclusive. We have conducted a systematic review with
meta-analysis to update current knowledge as a first step towards developing and 
deploying coordinated approaches to the control and, ultimately, elimination of
malaria-helminth co-infections among children living in endemic countries.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health and
Web of Science from each database inception until 16 March 2020, for
peer-reviewed articles reporting malaria-helminth co-infections in children
living in endemic countries. No language restriction was applied. Following
removal of duplicates, two reviewers independently screened the studies for
eligibility. We used the summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) as a measure of association (random-effects model). We also performed
Chi-square heterogeneity test based on Cochrane's Q and evaluated the severity of
heterogeneity using I2 statistics. The included studies were examined for
publication bias using a funnel plot and statistical significance was assessed
using Egger's test (bias if p<0.1). Fifty-five of the 3,507 citations screened
were eligible, 28 of which had sufficient data for meta-analysis. The 28 studies 
enrolled 22, 114 children in 13 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast
Asia and South America. Overall, the pooled estimates showed a prevalence of
Plasmodium-helminth co-infections of 17.7% (95% CI 12.7-23.2%). Summary estimates
from 14 studies showed a lower odds of P. falciparum infection in children
co-infected with Schistosoma spp (OR: 0.65; 95%CI: 0.37-1.16). Similar lower odds
of P. falciparum infection were observed from the summary estimates of 24 studies
in children co-infected with soil transmitted helminths (STH) (OR: 0.42; 95%CI:
0.28-0.64). When adjusted for age, gender, socio-economic status, nutritional
status and geographic location of the children, the risk of P. falciparum
infection in children co-infected with STH was higher compared with children who 
did not have STH infection (OR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.03-1.65). A subset of 16 studies
showed that the odds of anaemia were higher in children co-infected with
Plasmodium and STH than in children with Plasmodium infection alone (OR = 1.20;
95% CI: 0.59-2.45), and were almost equal in children co-infected with
Plasmodium-Schistosoma spp or Plasmodium infection alone (OR = 0.97, 95% CI:
0.30-3.14).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The current review suggests that prevalence of
malaria-helminth co-infection is high in children living in endemic countries.
The nature of the interactions between malaria and helminth infection and the
impact of the co-infection on anaemia remain inconclusive and may be modulated by
the immune responses of the affected children.

Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are embedded within complex socio-ecological
systems. While research has traditionally focused on the direct effects of VBDs
on human morbidity and mortality, it is increasingly clear that their impacts are
much more pervasive. VBDs are dynamically linked to feedbacks between
environmental conditions, vector ecology, disease burden, and societal responses 
that drive transmission. As a result, VBDs have had profound influence on human
history. Mechanisms include: (1) killing or debilitating large numbers of people,
with demographic and population-level impacts; (2) differentially affecting
populations based on prior history of disease exposure, immunity, and resistance;
(3) being weaponised to promote or justify hierarchies of power, colonialism,
racism, classism and sexism; (4) catalysing changes in ideas, institutions,
infrastructure, technologies and social practices in efforts to control disease
outbreaks; and (5) changing human relationships with the land and environment. We
use historical and archaeological evidence interpreted through an ecological lens
to illustrate how VBDs have shaped society and culture, focusing on case studies 
from four pertinent VBDs: plague, malaria, yellow fever and trypanosomiasis. By
comparing across diseases, time periods and geographies, we highlight the
enormous scope and variety of mechanisms by which VBDs have influenced human
history.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify significant symptoms and
nonsymptom-related factors for malaria diagnosis in endemic regions of Indonesia.
METHODS: Medical records are collected from patients suffering from malaria and
other febrile diseases from public hospitals in endemic regions of Indonesia.
Interviews with eight Indonesian medical doctors are conducted. Feature selection
and machine learning techniques are used to develop malaria classifiers for
identifying significant symptoms and nonsymptom-related factors.
RESULTS: Seven significant symptoms (duration of fever, headache, nausea and
vomiting, heartburn, severe symptom, dizziness, and joint pain) and patients'
history of malaria as a nonsymptom-related factor contribute most to malaria
diagnosis. As a symptom, fever duration is more significant than temperature or
fever for distinguishing malaria from other febrile diseases. Shivering, fever,
and sweating (known to indicate malaria presence in Indonesia) are shown to be
less significant than other symptoms in endemic regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Three most suitable malaria classifiers have been developed to
identify the significant features that can be used to predict malaria as distinct
from other febrile diseases. With extensive experiments on the classifiers, the
significant features identified can help medical doctors in the clinical
diagnosis of malaria and raise public awareness of significant malaria symptoms
at early stages.

Low-cost automated histopathology microscopy systems usually suffer from optical 
imperfections, producing images that are slightly Out of Focus (OoF). In this
work, a guided filter (GF) based image preprocessing is proposed for compensating
focal errors and its efficacy is demonstrated on images of healthy and malaria
infected red blood cells (h-RBCs and i-RBCs), and PAP smears. Since contrast
enhancement has been widely used as an image preprocessing step for the analysis 
of histopathology images, a systematic comparison is made with six such
prominently used methods, namely Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization
(CLAHE), RIQMC-based optimal histogram matching (ROHIM), modified L0,
Morphological Varying(MV)-Bitonic filter, unsharp mask filter and joint bilateral
filter. The images enhanced using GF approach lead to better segmentation
accuracy (upto 50% improvement over native images) and visual quality compared to
other approaches, without any change in the color tones. Thus, the proposed GF
approach is a viable solution for rectifying the OoF microscopy images without
the loss of the valuable diagnostic information presented by the color tone.

BACKGROUND: Light microscopy is often used for malaria diagnosis in the field.
However, it is time-consuming and quality of the results depends heavily on the
skill of microscopists. Automating malaria light microscopy is a promising
solution, but it still remains a challenge and an active area of research.
Current tools are often expensive and involve sophisticated hardware components, 
which makes it hard to deploy them in resource-limited areas.
RESULTS: We designed an Android mobile application called Malaria Screener, which
makes smartphones an affordable yet effective solution for automated malaria
light microscopy. The mobile app utilizes high-resolution cameras and computing
power of modern smartphones to screen both thin and thick blood smear images for 
P. falciparum parasites. Malaria Screener combines image acquisition, smear image
analysis, and result visualization in its slide screening process, and is
equipped with a database to provide easy access to the acquired data.
CONCLUSION: Malaria Screener makes the screening process faster, more consistent,
and less dependent on human expertise. The app is modular, allowing other
research groups to integrate their methods and models for image processing and
machine learning, while acquiring and analyzing their data.

BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) reduces vector densities and malaria
transmission, however, the most effective spraying intervals for IRS have not
been well established. We estimated the optimal timing interval for IRS using a
statistical approach.
METHODS: Six rounds of IRS were implemented in Tororo District, a historically
high malaria transmission setting in Uganda, during the study period (3 rounds
with bendiocarb active ingredient (Ficam®): December 2014 to December 2015, and 3
rounds with pirimiphos methyl active ingredient (Actellic 300®CS): June 2016 to
July 2018). A generalized additive model was used to estimate the optimal timing 
interval for IRS based on the predicted malaria incidence. The model was fitted
to clinical incidence data from a cohort of children aged 0.5-10 years from
selected households observed throughout the study period.
RESULTS: 494 children, 67% aged less than 5 years at enrolment were analysed.
Six-months period incidence of malaria decreased from 2.96 per person-years at
the baseline to 1.74 following the first round of IRS and then to 0.02 after 6
rounds of IRS. The optimal time interval for IRS differed between bendiocarb and 
pirimiphos methyl and by IRS round. To retain an optimum impact, bendiocarb would
require respraying 17 (95% CI: 14.2-21.0) weeks after application whereas
pirimiphos methyl could remain impactful for 40 (95% CI: 37.0-42.8) weeks,
although in the final year this estimates 36 (95% CI: 32.7-37.7) weeks. However, 
we could not estimate from the data the optimal time after the second and third
rounds of bendiocarb and after the second round of pirimiphos methyl. Neither the
amount of rainfall nor the EIR nor the distribution of nets were found to be
statistically significant for determining the time period between spray rounds.
CONCLUSION: In our setting, the effect of the two IRS products was distinct.
Statistically, pirimiphos methyl provided a longer window of protection than
bendiocarb, although impact varied between different spray rounds and years which
was not explained by rainfall or EIR or distribution of nets in our statistical
approach. Understanding the effectiveness of IRS and how long it lasts can help
for planning campaigns, but one should consider the financial cost and
insecticide resistance. Monitoring the timing of spray campaigns using clinical
incidence could be repeated in future programs to help determine the average
period of protectivity of these products.

BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drugs play a critical role in reducing malaria
morbidity and mortality, but their role is mediated by their effectiveness.
Effectiveness is defined as the probability that an anti-malarial drug will
successfully treat an individual infected with malaria parasites under routine
health care delivery system. Anti-malarial drug effectiveness (AmE) is influenced
by drug resistance, drug quality, health system quality, and patient adherence to
drug use; its influence on malaria burden varies through space and time.
METHODS: This study uses data from 232 efficacy trials comprised of 86,776
infected individuals to estimate the artemisinin-based and non-artemisinin-based 
AmE for treating falciparum malaria between 1991 and 2019. Bayesian
spatiotemporal models were fitted and used to predict effectiveness at the
pixel-level (5 km × 5 km). The median and interquartile ranges (IQR) of AmE are
presented for all malaria-endemic countries.
RESULTS: The global effectiveness of artemisinin-based drugs was 67.4% (IQR:
33.3-75.8), 70.1% (43.6-76.0) and 71.8% (46.9-76.4) for the 1991-2000, 2006-2010,
and 2016-2019 periods, respectively. Countries in central Africa, a few in South 
America, and in the Asian region faced the challenge of lower effectiveness of
artemisinin-based anti-malarials. However, improvements were seen after 2016,
leaving only a few hotspots in Southeast Asia where resistance to artemisinin and
partner drugs is currently problematic and in the central Africa where
socio-demographic challenges limit effectiveness. The use of artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) with a competent partner drug and having multiple ACT
as first-line treatment choice sustained high levels of effectiveness. High
levels of access to healthcare, human resource capacity, education, and proximity
to cities were associated with increased effectiveness. Effectiveness of
non-artemisinin-based drugs was much lower than that of artemisinin-based with no
improvement over time: 52.3% (17.9-74.9) for 1991-2000 and 55.5% (27.1-73.4) for 
2011-2015. Overall, AmE for artemisinin-based and non-artemisinin-based drugs
were, respectively, 29.6 and 36% below clinical efficacy as measured in
anti-malarial drug trials.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that health system performance, drug
quality and patient adherence influence the effectiveness of anti-malarials used 
in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria. These results provide guidance to
countries' treatment practises and are critical inputs for malaria prevalence and
incidence models used to estimate national level malaria burden.

Recent malaria vaccine trials in endemic areas have yielded disparate results
compared to studies conducted in non-endemic areas. A workshop was organized to
discuss the differential pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccine (Pre-E-Vac)
efficacies and underlying protective immunity under various conditions. It was
concluded that many factors, including vaccine technology platforms, host
genetics or physiologic conditions, and parasite and mosquito vector variations, 
may all contribute to Pre-E-Vac efficacy. Cross-disciplinary approaches are
needed to decipher the multi-dimensional variables that contribute to the
observed vaccine hypo-responsiveness. The malaria vaccine community has an
opportunity to leverage recent advances in immunology, systems vaccinology, and
high dimensionality data science methodologies to generate new clinical datasets 
with unprecedented levels of functional resolution as well as capitalize on
existing datasets for comprehensive and aggregate analyses. These approaches
would help to unlock our understanding of Pre-E-Vac immunology and to translate
new candidates from the laboratory to the field more predictably.

Every year, 435,000 people worldwide die from Malaria, mainly in Africa and Asia.
However, malaria is a curable and preventable disease. Most countries are
developing malaria elimination plans to meet sustainable development goal three, 
target 3.3, which includes ending the epidemic of malaria by 2030. Rwanda,
through the malaria strategic plan 2012-2018 set a target to reduce malaria
incidence by 42% from 2012 to 2018. Assessing the health policy and taking a
decision using the incidence rate approach is becoming more challenging. We are
proposing suitable statistical methods that handle spatial structure and
uncertainty on the relative risk that is relevant to National Malaria Control
Program. We used a spatio-temporal model to estimate the excess probability for
decision making at a small area on evaluating reduction of incidence. SIR and BYM
models were developed using routine data from Health facilities for the period
from 2012 to 2018 in Rwanda. The fitted model was used to generate relative risk 
(RR) estimates comparing the risk with the malaria risk in 2012, and to assess
the probability of attaining the set target goal per area. The results showed an 
overall increase in malaria in 2013 to 2018 as compared to 2012. Ofall sectors in
Rwanda, 47.36% failed to meet targeted reduction in incidence from 2012 to 2018. 
Our approach of using excess probability method to evaluate attainment of target 
or identifying threshold is a relevant statistical method, which will enable the 
Rwandan Government to sustain malaria control and monitor the effectiveness of
targeted interventions.

Mali aims to reach the pre-elimination stage of malaria by the next decade. This 
study used functional regression models to predict the incidence of malaria as a 
function of past meteorological patterns to better prevent and to act proactively
against impending malaria outbreaks. All data were collected over a five-year
period (2012-2017) from 1400 persons who sought treatment at Dangassa's community
health center. Rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed variables were
collected. Functional Generalized Spectral Additive Model (FGSAM), Functional
Generalized Linear Model (FGLM), and Functional Generalized Kernel Additive Model
(FGKAM) were used to predict malaria incidence as a function of the pattern of
meteorological indicators over a continuum of the 18 weeks preceding the week of 
interest. Their respective outcomes were compared in terms of predictive
abilities. The results showed that (1) the highest malaria incidence rate
occurred in the village 10 to 12 weeks after we observed a pattern of air
humidity levels >65%, combined with two or more consecutive rain episodes and a
mean wind speed <1.8 m/s; (2) among the three models, the FGLM obtained the best 
results in terms of prediction; and (3) FGSAM was shown to be a good compromise
between FGLM and FGKAM in terms of flexibility and simplicity. The models showed 
that some meteorological conditions may provide a basis for detection of future
outbreaks of malaria. The models developed in this paper are useful for
implementing preventive strategies using past meteorological and past malaria
incidence.

Malaria is an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted
through mosquito bites. Symptoms include fever, headache, and vomiting, and in
severe cases, seizures and coma. The World Health Organization reports that there
were 228 million cases and 405,000 deaths in 2018, with Africa representing 93%
of total cases and 94% of total deaths. Rapid diagnosis and subsequent treatment 
are the most effective means to mitigate the progression into serious symptoms.
However, many fatal cases have been attributed to poor access to healthcare
resources for malaria screenings. In these low-resource settings, the use of
light microscopy on a thin blood smear with Giemsa stain is used to examine the
severity of infection, requiring tedious and manual counting by a trained
technician. To address the malaria endemic in Africa and its coexisting
socioeconomic constraints, we propose an automated, mobile phone-based screening 
process that takes advantage of already existing resources. Through the use of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we utilize a SSD multibox object detection 
architecture that rapidly processes thin blood smears acquired via light
microscopy to isolate images of individual red blood cells with 90.4% average
precision. Then we implement a FSRCNN model that upscales 32 × 32 low-resolution 
images to 128 × 128 high-resolution images with a PSNR of 30.2, compared to a
baseline PSNR of 24.2 through traditional bicubic interpolation. Lastly, we
utilize a modified VGG16 CNN that classifies red blood cells as either infected
or uninfected with an accuracy of 96.5% in a balanced class dataset. These
sequential models create a streamlined screening platform, giving the healthcare 
provider the number of malaria-infected red blood cells in a given sample. Our
deep learning platform is efficient enough to operate exclusively on low-tier
smartphone hardware, eliminating the need for high-speed internet connection.

CD4+ T cell functional inhibition (exhaustion) is a hallmark of malaria and
correlates with impaired parasite control and infection chronicity. However, the 
mechanisms of CD4+ T cell exhaustion are still poorly understood. In this study, 
we show that Ag-experienced (Ag-exp) CD4+ T cell exhaustion during Plasmodium
yoelii nonlethal infection occurs alongside the reduction in mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) activity and restriction in CD4+ T cell glycolytic capacity. We 
demonstrate that the loss of glycolytic metabolism and mTOR activity within the
exhausted Ag-expCD4+ T cell population during infection coincides with reduction 
in T-bet expression. T-bet was found to directly bind to and control the
transcription of various mTOR and metabolism-related genes within effector CD4+ T
cells. Consistent with this, Ag-expTh1 cells exhibited significantly higher and
sustained mTOR activity than effector T-bet- (non-Th1) Ag-expT cells throughout
the course of malaria. We identified mTOR to be redundant for sustaining T-bet
expression in activated Th1 cells, whereas mTOR was necessary but not sufficient 
for maintaining IFN-γ production by Th1 cells. Immunotherapy targeting PD-1,
CTLA-4, and IL-27 blocked CD4+ T cell exhaustion during malaria infection and was
associated with elevated T-bet expression and a concomitant increased CD4+ T cell
glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that mTOR activity is
linked to T-bet in Ag-expCD4+ T cells but that reduction in mTOR activity may not
directly underpin Ag-expTh1 cell loss and exhaustion during malaria infection.
These data have implications for therapeutic reactivation of exhausted CD4+ T
cells during malaria infection and other chronic conditions.

Malaria transmission largely depends on environmental, climatic, and hydrological
conditions. In Mali, malaria epidemiological patterns are nested within three
ecological zones. This study aimed at assessing the relationship between those
conditions and the incidence of malaria in Dangassa and Koila, Mali. Malaria data
was collected through passive case detection at community health facilities of
each study site from June 2015 to January 2017. Climate and environmental data
were obtained over the same time period from the Goddard Earth Sciences
(Giovanni) platform and hydrological data from Mali hydraulic services. A
generalized additive model was used to determine the lagged time between each
principal component analysis derived component and the incidence of malaria
cases, and also used to analyze the relationship between malaria and the lagged
components in a multivariate approach. Malaria transmission patterns were bimodal
at both sites, but peak and lull periods were longer lasting for Koila study
site. Temperatures were associated with malaria incidence in both sites. In
Dangassa, the wind speed (p = 0.005) and river heights (p = 0.010) contributed to
increasing malaria incidence, in contrast to Koila, where it was humidity (p <
0.001) and vegetation (p = 0.004). The relationships between environmental
factors and malaria incidence differed between the two settings, implying
different malaria dynamics and adjustments in the conception and plan of
interventions.

Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be
calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of
model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the
goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review 
provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious
disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based
methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis,
and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018.
Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and
calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We
extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model
validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met 
the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative
GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy-either an optimisation 
algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied
widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the 
remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be
identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method
(12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF
measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a
minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice
of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. 
Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling
studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better
documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility
and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for
research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions
about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.

Spatial analysis has become an increasingly used analytic approach to describe
and analyze spatial characteristics of disease burden, but the depth and coverage
of its usage for health surveys data in Sub-Saharan Africa are not well known.
The objective of this scoping review was to conduct an evaluation of studies
using spatial statistics approaches for national health survey data in the SSA
region. An organized literature search for studies related to spatial statistics 
and national health surveys was conducted through PMC, PubMed/Medline, Scopus,
NLM Catalog, and Science Direct electronic databases. Of the 4,193 unique
articles identified, 153 were included in the final review. Spatial smoothing and
prediction methods were predominant (n = 108), followed by spatial description
aggregation (n = 25), and spatial autocorrelation and clustering (n = 19).
Bayesian statistics methods and lattice data modelling were predominant (n =
108). Most studies focused on malaria and fever (n = 47) followed by health
services coverage (n = 38). Only fifteen studies employed nonstandard spatial
analyses (e.g., spatial model assessment, joint spatial modelling, accounting for
survey design). We recommend that for future spatial analysis using health survey
data in the SSA region, there must be an improve recognition and awareness of the
potential dangers of a naïve application of spatial statistical methods. We also 
recommend a wide range of applications using big health data and the future of
data science for health systems to monitor and evaluate impacts that are not well
understood at local levels.

The examination of the complex cell biology of the human malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum usually relies on the time-consuming generation of
transgenic parasites. Here, metabolic labeling and click chemistry are employed
as a fast transfection-independent method for the microscopic examination of
protein S-palmitoylation, an important post-translational modification during the
asexual intraerythrocytic replication of P. falciparum. Applying various
microscopy approaches such as confocal, single-molecule switching, and electron
microscopy, differences in the extent of labeling within the different asexual
developmental stages of P. falciparum and the host erythrocytes over time are
observed.

BACKGROUND: In the context of task shifting, a promoted approach to healthcare
delivery in resource-poor settings, trained community health workers (CHWs) have 
been shown to be effective in delivering quality care of malaria for febrile
under-5 children. While their effectiveness has been documented, the fidelity of 
implementation (FOI) has not been adequately studied. By understanding and
measuring whether an intervention has been performed with fidelity, researchers
and practitioners gain a better understanding of how and why an intervention
works, and the extent to which outcomes can be improved. The objective of this
study was to assess the FOI of a recommended protocol for malaria care by CHWs in
a resource-poor setting in Nigeria.
METHODS: Thirty-five female CHWs who participated in a 3-day training on home
management of malaria among under-5 children were studied. They managed 1,646
children over the implementation period and then underwent evaluation via a
one-time hospital-based observation by the trainers. During the evaluation, a
pre-tested standard checklist was used to compute performance scores for CHWs;
doctors and nurses were selected to serve as the gold standard for comparison.
Performance scores (PS) recorded during the evaluation were used to assess
adherence and compliance with the recommended treatment protocol.
RESULTS: Of the 4 skill domains assessed, adherence was greatest for compliance
with malaria treatment recommendations (94%) and lowest for post-treatment
initiation counseling of home-based caregivers (69%). The average overall
adherence of 83% was comparable to adherence by gold standard comparators. Mean
PS was not found to be significantly associated with CHW demographics. Scores for
clinical evaluation among those whose occupation was not healthcare-related were 
significantly lowered by 0.52 [95% CI (1.05-0.01), p = 0.05]. Compliance with the
treatment protocol increased by 23% for every unit increase in total PS
(p = 0.07) and doubled for every unit increase in scores for post-treatment
initiation counseling of caregivers (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Studying intervention fidelity stands to identify the shortcomings
of implementation and specific areas to target for improvement in future adoption
or implementation. This study concludes that future trainings should emphasize
clinical evaluation and post-treatment counseling of caregivers by CHWs to ensure
the best outcome for children.

Background & objectives: With the development of technological know-how, in
recent years, malaria research in India has advanced to a great extent and the
corresponding research is being translated into the form of publications, which
has started to pile in thousands over the years. The purpose of the present study
was to perform a bibliometric analysis on malaria research in India from its
inception.
Methods: The Web of Science (WoS) platform developed by Clarivate Analytics was
utilized to retrieve publications on malaria research in India. The publications 
were retrieved in bibtex format and were further used for analysis in "R"
Bibliometrix package. The analysis included number of publications in each year
along with their keywords, title, authors, institutes, abstract, journal name and
countries.
Results: A total of 2334 publications on malaria in India were obtained from 1909
to 2019 (March). The emerging trends on themes of malaria research in India were 
unraveled with the help of keywords co-occurrence network analysis. The
bibliometric analysis shed light on the evolution of journals and trends on
choice of journals that the authors made over the years and the contribution of
different countries in malaria research.
Interpretation & conclusion: The bibliometric analysis performed over 110 yr not 
only contributes towards understanding the trends based on research topics, but
also on the importance of data science. Assuming the fact that the number of
publications would increase from thousands to lakhs in future; going forward, it 
has become imperative for the researchers and students to develop methods using
computer-based algorithms and carry out literature review which allows for
in-depth study of vast amount of literature.

Bioinformatics and data science research have boundless potential across Africa
due to its high levels of genetic diversity and disproportionate burden of
infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS, Ebola virus
disease, and Lassa fever. This work lays out an incremental approach for reaching
underserved countries in bioinformatics and data science research through a
progression of capacity building, training, and research efforts. Two global
health informatics training programs sponsored by the Fogarty International
Center (FIC) were carried out at the University of Sciences, Techniques and
Technologies of Bamako, Mali (USTTB) between 1999 and 2011. Together with
capacity building efforts through the West Africa International Centers of
Excellence in Malaria Research (ICEMR), this progress laid the groundwork for a
bioinformatics and data science training program launched at USTTB as part of the
Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative. Prior to the global
health informatics training, its trainees published first or second authorship
and third or higher authorship manuscripts at rates of 0.40 and 0.10 per year,
respectively. Following the training, these rates increased to 0.70 and 1.23 per 
year, respectively, which was a statistically significant increase (p < 0.001).
The bioinformatics and data science training program at USTTB commenced in 2017
focusing on student, faculty, and curriculum tiers of enhancement. The program's 
sustainable measures included institutional support for core elements, university
tuition and fees, resource sharing and coordination with local research projects 
and companion training programs, increased student and faculty publication rates,
and increased research proposal submissions. Challenges reliance of high-speed
bandwidth availability on short-term funding, lack of a discounted software
portal for basic software applications, protracted application processes for
United States visas, lack of industry job positions, and low publication rates in
the areas of bioinformatics and data science. Long-term, incremental processes
are necessary for engaging historically underserved countries in bioinformatics
and data science research. The multi-tiered enhancement approach laid out here
provides a platform for generating bioinformatics and data science technicians,
teachers, researchers, and program managers. Increased literature on
bioinformatics and data science training approaches and progress is needed to
provide a framework for establishing benchmarks on the topics.

BACKGROUND: Among women, trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually
transmitted infection worldwide, and is associated with serious reproductive
morbidity, poor birth outcomes, and amplified HIV transmission. Single-dose
metronidazole is the first-line treatment for trichomoniasis. However, bacterial 
vaginosis can alter treatment efficacy in HIV-infected women, and single-dose
metronidazole treatment might not always clear infection. We compared single-dose
metronidazole with a 7-day dose for the treatment of trichomoniasis among
HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant women and tested whether efficacy was modified by
bacterial vaginosis.
METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial,
participants were recruited at three sexual health clinics in the USA. We
included women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis infection according to clinical
screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single
dose of 2 g of metronidazole (single-dose group) or 500 mg of metronidazole twice
daily for 7 days (7-day-dose group). The randomisation was done by blocks of four
or six for each site. Patients and investigators were aware of treatment
assignment. The primary outcome was T vaginalis infection by intention to treat, 
at test-of-cure 4 weeks after completion of treatment. The analysis of the
primary outcome per nucleic acid amplification test or culture was also
stratified by bacterial vaginosis status. This trial is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01018095, and with the US Food and Drug
Administration, number IND118276, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS: Participants were recruited from Oct 6, 2014, to April 26, 2017. Of the
1028 patients assessed for eligibility, 623 women were randomly assigned to
treatment groups (311 women in the single-dose group and 312 women in the
7-day-dose group; intention-to-treat population). Although planned enrolment had 
been 1664 women, the study was stopped early because of funding limitations.
Patients in the 7-day-dose group were less likely to be T vaginalis positive at
test-of-cure than those in the single-dose group (34 [11%] of 312 vs 58 [19%] of 
311, relative risk 0·55, 95% CI 0·34-0·70; p<0·0001). Bacterial vaginosis status 
had no significant effect on relative risk (p=0·17). Self-reported adherence was 
96% in the 7-day-dose group and 99% in the single-dose group. Side-effects were
similar by group; the most common side-effect was nausea (124 [23%]), followed by
headache (38 [7%]) and vomiting (19 [4%]).
INTERPRETATION: The 7-day-dose metronidazole should be the preferred treatment
for trichomoniasis among women.

Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related apicomplexan pathogens contain a 
nonphotosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast. Derived from an unusual
secondary eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis, the apicoplast is a fascinating
organelle whose function and biogenesis rely on a complex amalgamation of
bacterial and algal pathways. Because these pathways are distinct from the human 
host, the apicoplast is an excellent source of novel antimalarial targets.
Despite its biomedical importance and evolutionary significance, the absence of a
reliable apicoplast proteome has limited most studies to the handful of pathways 
identified by homology to bacteria or primary chloroplasts, precluding our
ability to study the most novel apicoplast pathways. Here, we combine proximity
biotinylation-based proteomics (BioID) and a new machine learning algorithm to
generate a high-confidence apicoplast proteome consisting of 346 proteins.
Critically, the high accuracy of this proteome significantly outperforms previous
prediction-based methods and extends beyond other BioID studies of unique
parasite compartments. Half of identified proteins have unknown function, and 77%
are predicted to be important for normal blood-stage growth. We validate the
apicoplast localization of a subset of novel proteins and show that an
ATP-binding cassette protein ABCF1 is essential for blood-stage survival and
plays a previously unknown role in apicoplast biogenesis. These findings indicate
critical organellar functions for newly discovered apicoplast proteins. The
apicoplast proteome will be an important resource for elucidating unique pathways
derived from secondary endosymbiosis and prioritizing antimalarial drug targets.

Integrated Serologic Surveillance of Population Immunity and Disease
Transmission.

Arnold BF, Scobie HM, Priest JW, Lammie PJ.

Antibodies are unique among biomarkers in their ability to identify persons with 
protective immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases and to measure past exposure 
to diverse pathogens. Most infectious disease surveillance maintains a
single-disease focus, but broader testing of existing serologic surveys with
multiplex antibody assays would create new opportunities for integrated
surveillance. In this perspective, we highlight multiple areas for potential
synergy where integrated surveillance could add more value to public health
efforts than the current trend of independent disease monitoring through vertical
programs. We describe innovations in laboratory and data science that should
accelerate integration and identify remaining challenges with respect to specimen
collection, testing, and analysis. Throughout, we illustrate how information
generated through integrated surveillance platforms can create new opportunities 
to more quickly and precisely identify global health program gaps that range from
undervaccination to emerging pathogens to multilayered health disparities that
span diverse communicable diseases.

Unfolding the Genome: The Case Study of P. falciparum.

The development of new ways to probe samples for the three-dimensional (3D)
structure of DNA paves the way for in depth and systematic analyses of the genome
architecture. 3C-like methods coupled with high-throughput sequencing can now
assess physical interactions between pairs of loci in a genome-wide fashion, thus
enabling the creation of genome-by-genome contact maps. The spreading of such
protocols creates many new opportunities for methodological development: how can 
we infer 3D models from these contact maps? Can such models help us gain insights
into biological processes? Several recent studies applied such protocols to P.
falciparum (the deadliest of the five human malaria parasites), assessing its
genome organization at different moments of its life cycle. With its small
genomic size, fairly simple (yet changing) genomic organization during its
lifecyle and strong correlation between chromatin folding and gene expression,
this parasite is the ideal case study for applying and developing methods to
infer 3D models and use them for downstream analysis. Here, I review a set of
methods used to build and analyse three-dimensional models from contact maps data
with a special highlight on P. falciparum's genome organization.

Importance: The quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment
(qSOFA) score has not been well-evaluated in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs).
Objective: To assess the association of qSOFA with excess hospital death among
patients with suspected infection in LMICs and to compare qSOFA with the systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria.
Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective secondary analysis of 8 cohort 
studies and 1 randomized clinical trial from 2003 to 2017. This study included
6569 hospitalized adults with suspected infection in emergency departments,
inpatient wards, and intensive care units of 17 hospitals in 10 LMICs across
sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
Exposures: Low (0), moderate (1), or high (≥2) qSOFA score (range, 0 [best] to 3 
[worst]) or SIRS criteria (range, 0 [best] to 4 [worst]) within 24 hours of
presentation to study hospital.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Predictive validity (measured as incremental hospital
mortality beyond that predicted by baseline risk factors, as a marker of sepsis
or analogous severe infectious course) of the qSOFA score (primary) and SIRS
criteria (secondary).
Results: The cohorts were diverse in enrollment criteria, demographics (median
ages, 29-54 years; males range, 36%-76%), HIV prevalence (range, 2%-43%), cause
of infection, and hospital mortality (range, 1%-39%). Among 6218 patients with
nonmissing outcome status in the combined cohort, 643 (10%) died. Compared with a
low or moderate score, a high qSOFA score was associated with increased risk of
death overall (19% vs 6%; difference, 13% [95% CI, 11%-14%]; odds ratio, 3.6 [95%
CI, 3.0-4.2]) and across cohorts (P < .05 for 8 of 9 cohorts). Compared with a
low qSOFA score, a moderate qSOFA score was also associated with increased risk
of death overall (8% vs 3%; difference, 5% [95% CI, 4%-6%]; odds ratio, 2.8 [95% 
CI, 2.0-3.9]), but not in every cohort (P < .05 in 2 of 7 cohorts). High, vs low 
or moderate, SIRS criteria were associated with a smaller increase in risk of
death overall (13% vs 8%; difference, 5% [95% CI, 3%-6%]; odds ratio, 1.7 [95%
CI, 1.4-2.0]) and across cohorts (P < .05 for 4 of 9 cohorts). qSOFA
discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC],
0.70 [95% CI, 0.68-0.72]) was superior to that of both the baseline model (AUROC,
0.56 [95% CI, 0.53-0.58; P < .001) and SIRS (AUROC, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.57-0.62];
P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: When assessed among hospitalized adults with suspected
infection in 9 LMIC cohorts, the qSOFA score identified infected patients at risk
of death beyond that explained by baseline factors. However, the predictive
validity varied among cohorts and settings, and further research is needed to
better understand potential generalizability.

The development of malaria parasites throughout their various life cycle stages
is coordinated by changes in gene expression. We previously showed that the
three-dimensional organization of the Plasmodium falciparum genome is strongly
associated with gene expression during its replication cycle inside red blood
cells. Here, we analyze genome organization in the P. falciparum and P. vivax
transmission stages. Major changes occur in the localization and interactions of 
genes involved in pathogenesis and immune evasion, host cell invasion, sexual
differentiation, and master regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, we
observe reorganization of subtelomeric heterochromatin around genes involved in
host cell remodeling. Depletion of heterochromatin protein 1 (PfHP1) resulted in 
loss of interactions between virulence genes, confirming that PfHP1 is essential 
for maintenance of the repressive center. Our results suggest that the
three-dimensional genome structure of human malaria parasites is strongly
connected with transcriptional activity of specific gene families throughout the 
life cycle.

Primaquine (PQ) is a commonly used drug that can prevent the transmission of
Plasmodium falciparum malaria, however toxicity limits its use. We prepared five 
groups of PQ derivatives: amides 1a-k, ureas 2a-k, semicarbazides 3a,b,
acylsemicarbazides 4a-k and bis-ureas 5a-v, and evaluated them for antimalarial
activity in vitro against the erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum NF54.
Particular substituents, such as trityl (in 2j and 5r) and methoxybenzhydryl (in 
3b and 5v) were associated with a favorable cytotoxicity-to-activity ratio. To
systematically link structural features of PQ derivatives to antiplasmodial
activity, we performed a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)
study using the Support Vector Machines machine learning method. This yielded a
highly accurate statistical model (R2 = 0.776 in cross-validation), which was
used to prioritize novel candidate compounds. Seven novel PQ-ureidoamides 10a-g
were synthesized and evaluated for activity, highlighting the benzhydryl
ureidoamides 10e and 10f derived from p-chlorophenylglycine. Further experiments 
on human cell lines revealed that 10e and 10f are an order of magnitude less
toxic than PQ in vitro while having antimalarial activity indistinguishable from 
PQ. The toxicity profile of novel compounds 10 toward human cells was
particularly favorable when the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was
inhibited, while toxicity of PQ was exacerbated by G6PD inhibition. Our work
therefore highlights promising lead compounds for the development of effective
antimalarial drugs that may also be safer for G6PD-deficient patients. In
addition, we provide computational inferences of antimalarial activity and
cytotoxicity for thousands of PQ-like molecular structures.

BACKGROUND: Chloroquine was used for malaria treatment until resistant Plasmodium
falciparum was identified. Because 4-aminoquinolines with modified side chains,
such as AQ-13, are active against resistant parasites, we compared AQ-13 against 
artemether plus lumefantrine for treatment of uncomplicated P falciparum malaria.
METHODS: We did a randomised, non-inferiority trial. We screened men (≥18 years) 
with uncomplicated malaria in Missira (northeast Mali) and Bamako (capital of
Mali) for eligibility (≥2000 asexual P falciparum parasites per μL of blood).
Eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the artemether plus
lumefantrine group or AQ-13 group by permuting blocks of four with a random
number generator. Physicians and others caring for the participants were masked, 
except for participants who received treatment and the research pharmacist who
implemented the randomisation and provided treatment. Participants received
either 80 mg of oral artemether and 480 mg of oral lumefantrine twice daily for 3
days or 638·50 mg of AQ-13 base (two oral capsules) on days 1 and 2, and 319·25
mg base (one oral capsule) on day 3. Participants were monitored for parasite
clearance (50 μL blood samples twice daily at 12 h intervals until two
consecutive negative samples were obtained) and interviewed for adverse events
(once every day) as inpatients during week 1. During the 5-week outpatient
follow-up, participants were examined for adverse events and recurrent infection 
twice per week. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis
and per-protocol analysis, except for those who dropped out in the per-protocol
analysis. The composite primary outcome was clearance of asexual parasites and
fever by day 7, and absence of recrudescent infection by parasites with the same 
molecular markers from days 8 to 42 (defined as cure). Non-inferiority was
considered established if the proportion of patients who were cured was higher
for artemether plus lumefantrine than for AQ-13 and the upper limit of the 95% CI
was less than the non-inferiority margin of 15%. This trial is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01614964.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 6 and Nov 18, 2013, and between Sept 18 and Nov 20, 2015,
66 Malian men with uncomplicated malaria were enrolled. 33 participants were
randomly assigned to each group. There were no serious adverse events (grade 2-4)
and asexual parasites were cleared by day 7 in both groups. 453 less-severe
adverse events (≤grade 1) were reported: 214 in the combination group and 239 in 
the AQ-13 group. Two participants withdrew from the AQ-13 group after parasite
clearance and three were lost to follow-up. In the artemether plus lumefantrine
group, two participants had late treatment failures (same markers as original
isolates). On the basis of the per-protocol analysis, the AQ-13 and artemether
plus lumefantrine groups had similar proportions cured (28 [100%] of 28 vs 31
[93·9%] of 33; p=0·50) and AQ-13 was not inferior to artemether plus lumefantrine
(difference -6·1%, 95% CI -14·7 to 2·4). Proportions cured were also similar
between the groups in the intention-to-treat analysis (28 of 33, 84·8% for AQ-13 
vs 31 of 33, 93·9% for artemether and lumefantrine; p=0·43) but the upper bound
of the 95% CI exceeded the 15% non-inferiority margin (difference 9·1%, 95% CI
-5·6 to 23·8).
INTERPRETATION: The per-protocol analysis suggested non-inferiority of AQ-13 to
artemether plus lumefantrine. By contrast, the intention-to-treat analysis, which
included two participants who withdrew and three who were lost to follow-up from 
the AQ-13 group, did not meet the criterion for non-inferiority of AQ-13,
although there were no AQ-13 treatment failures. Studies with more participants
(and non-immune participants) are needed to decide whether widespread use of
modified 4-aminoquinolones should be recommended.
